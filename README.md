This is work in progress, not yet functional!

-- Bugs
* When block breaks, make particles fit the texture

-- TODO
* Make block harder to break
* Give block a recipe
* On tick, store vector for each entity. update vectors based on distance to each block, then move entities
* Figure out gravity block destruction
* Interactions with water flow
